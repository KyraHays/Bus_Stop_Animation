# Bus_Stop_Animation

## Project Name:
Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description:
This map shows each bus stop from MIT to Harvard.

## Installation / How to run:
Copy the .css, .js, and .html files in the same directory, load the index.html file into a web browser

## Usage:

## Support:
Staff at MIT.

## Roadmap:
I would like to add some zoom controls and change the color of the markers. I think it would also be cool to add some buttons to choose the map style (dark, street, topographic, etc.).
